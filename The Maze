The problem you're referring to, **"The Maze"**, can be found on LeetCode with the following details:

### Problem Overview:
You are given an `m x n` maze represented by a 2D grid. The maze contains:
- `0` for open paths.
- `1` for walls.
- The goal is to determine whether there is a path from a starting point `(start)` to an ending point `(destination)`.

The problem requires checking if a ball can travel from the starting point to the destination by moving in one of the four directions: **up**, **down**, **left**, or **right**, but the ball stops when it hits a wall (`1`).

---

### Key Points:
- The ball can only move in straight lines.
- The ball continues moving in a direction until it hits a wall, after which it stops and you can change direction.
- You need to return `true` if a path exists from the start to the destination and `false` otherwise.

### Constraints:
- The ball must move continuously in a direction (can't change directions in the middle of a step).
- The maze has boundaries, so you can't move outside of the grid.

---

### Approach:

To solve this problem, a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** or **Depth-First Search (DFS)** approach can be applied to explore all possible paths. Hereâ€™s how you could approach this problem:

1. **DFS/BFS Traversal**:
   - Start from the `start` position and attempt to move in all four directions.
   - The ball can move until it hits a wall. At each stop, we check if we've reached the destination.
   - If we reach the destination, return `true`.
   - If we exhaust all possible directions and can't reach the destination, return `false`.

2. **Mark Visited**:
   - Use a `visited` array to keep track of the cells you have already visited to avoid cycles and redundant work.

### Solution Using DFS (Depth-First Search):
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canReachDestination(vector<vector<int>>& maze, vector<int>& start, vector<int>& destination) {
        int m = maze.size(), n = maze[0].size();
        vector<vector<bool>> visited(m, vector<bool>(n, false));
        
        // Directions for up, down, left, and right
        vector<pair<int, int>> directions = {{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}};
        
        // Helper function for DFS
        bool dfs(int x, int y) {
            // Base case: if out of bounds or already visited
            if (x < 0 || x >= m || y < 0 || y >= n || maze[x][y] == 1 || visited[x][y]) {
                return false;
            }
            // Mark the current cell as visited
            visited[x][y] = true;
            // If we reached the destination, return true
            if (x == destination[0] && y == destination[1]) {
                return true;
            }
            
            // Explore all four directions
            for (auto& dir : directions) {
                int nx = x, ny = y;
                // Move in the current direction until hitting a wall
                while (nx + dir.first >= 0 && nx + dir.first < m && ny + dir.second >= 0 && ny + dir.second < n && maze[nx + dir.first][ny + dir.second] == 0) {
                    nx += dir.first;
                    ny += dir.second;
                }
                // Recursive DFS from the new position
                if (dfs(nx, ny)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
            return false;
        }
        
        // Start DFS from the start position
        return dfs(start[0], start[1]);
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
- **DFS**: We use Depth-First Search to explore all possible paths starting from the `start` position.
- **Direction Movement**: We check all four possible directions (up, down, left, right). For each direction, we move until the ball hits a wall (`1`) and then recursively check from that position.
- **Base Case**: If the ball reaches the destination, return `true`. If it's out of bounds, hits a wall, or revisits a position, return `false`.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\), since in the worst case, we may visit every cell once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\), for the visited array and recursive stack space.

### Example:

Input:
```plaintext
maze = [
 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
start = [0, 4]
destination = [3, 2]
```

Output: `true`

### Explanation:
- The ball can move from `(0, 4)` to `(0, 1)` and continues until it reaches the destination at `(3, 2)`.
